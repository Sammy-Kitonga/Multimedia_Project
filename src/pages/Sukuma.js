        <p>
          <strong>Rites of Passage:</strong> Birth ceremonies mark earliest rituals for gender identity and community belonging. Unlike some cultures, the Sukuma have no formal age-set initiation into adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chiefly Systems:</strong> Males often serve as diviners and village leaders, while inheritance and succession follow patrilineal descent with preferences for brother's sons.

        <p>
          <strong>Marriage Practices:</strong> Polygyny is common among the Sukuma. Bride-wealth (usually cattle) secures family alliances. Weddings are vibrant multi-day celebrations featuring elaborate beadwork, rhythmic drumming, energetic dancing, and ritual competitions.

        <p>
          <strong>Annual Festivals:</strong> Major celebrations held during June–September include dance competitions like Bugobogobo and Bukomyalume, showcasing traditional songs, colorful costumes, ceremonial masks, and community drumming.
